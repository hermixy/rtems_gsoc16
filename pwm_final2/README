Pulse Width Modulation uses system frequency of Beagle Bone Black.

System frequency = SYSCLKOUT, that is, CPU clock. TBCLK = SYSCLKOUT(By Default)
SYCLKOUT = 100 MHz

Please visit following link to check why SYSCLKDIV = 100MHz:

(Refer TRM Table 15-41 as well)

To generate different frequencies with help of PWM module , SYSCLKOUT need to be
scaled down which will act as TBCLK and TBCLK will be base clock for the pwm
sub system.

TBCLK = SYSCLKOUT/(HSPCLKDIV * CLKDIV)

                 |----------------| 
                 |     clock      | 
 SYSCLKOUT--->   |                |---> TBCLK 
                 |   prescale     |
                 |----------------|         
                   ^           ^
                   |           |
 TBCTL[CLKDIV]-----            ------TBCTL[HSPCLKDIV]

CLKDIV and HSPCLKDIV bits are part of TBCTL registerm (Refer TRM).
Please use following values of CLKDIV to scale down sysclk respectively
0h (R/W) = /1 
1h (R/W) = /2
2h (R/W) = /4
3h (R/W) = /8
4h (R/W) = /16
5h (R/W) = /32
6h (R/W) = /64
7h (R/W) = /128

Please use following value of HSPCLKDIV to scale down sysclk respectively

0h (R/W) = /1
1h (R/W) = /2
2h (R/W) = /4
3h (R/W) = /6
4h (R/W) = /8
5h (R/W) = /10
6h (R/W) = /12
7h (R/W) = /14

How to generate frequency ?

freq = 1/Period
TBPRD register is responsible to generate frequency.

By default TBCLK = SYSCLKOUT = 100 MHz

Here by default period is 1/100MHz = 10 nsec

Following example shows value to be loaded into TBPRD
 
e.g. TBPRD = 1 = 1 count
  count x Period = 1 x 1ns = 1ns
  freq = 1/Period = 1 / 1ns = 100 MHz

For duty cycle CMPA and CMPB are the responsible registers.

To generate single with 50% Duty cycle & 100MHz freq.
 
 CMPA = count x Duty Cycle
       = TBPRD x Duty Cycle
       = 1 x 50/100
       = 0.2
